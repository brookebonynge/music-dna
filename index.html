  <h1>Music isn’t just a subject to study; it’s a journey through history itself.</h1>
  <h4>Music is constantly evolving—but like any good remix, it never forgets its roots. From jazz riffs showing up in hip-hop beats to classical drama woven into cinematic pop, every genre borrows, blends, and builds off the ones before it. In this project, I’m exploring the DNA of music: how genres have shifted over time, gained popularity, and cross-pollinated with one another—yet still carry traces of their original essence. Because in the world of music, everything changes, but the rhythm of inspiration stays the same.</h4>

  <!-- === Classical === -->
  <section class="genre-section">
    <h2 class="genre-heading">Classical</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">Classical music is the OG of organized sound—think sweeping symphonies, dramatic crescendos, and intricate harmonies. Born in 18th-century Europe, it set the foundation for Western music with legendary composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach leading the charge. While it may not dominate Spotify charts today, its influence echoes through movie scores, pop ballads, and even video game soundtracks. Timeless, technical, and totally dramatic—classical music is proof that good composition never goes out of style.</p>

  <!-- === Blues === -->
  <section class="genre-section">
    <h2 class="genre-heading">Blues</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">Blues is raw emotion turned into rhythm—born from the deep South in the late 1800s, it gave a voice to struggle, soul, and storytelling. With its signature 12-bar structure, moody guitar riffs, and heartfelt lyrics, blues laid the groundwork for genres like rock, jazz, and hip-hop. It's the kind of music that says a lot with just a few notes—and somehow, it always hits you right in the feels. Simple, soulful, and seriously influential, blues is the heartache that built a music empire.</p>

  <!-- === Jazz === -->
  <section class="genre-section">
    <h2 class="genre-heading">Jazz</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">Jazz is music with a mind of its own—improvised, unpredictable, and always cool. Born in the 1920s in New Orleans, jazz blended blues, ragtime, and classical flair into something bold and brand new. It’s known for swing rhythms, soulful solos, and that “you had to be there” kind of energy. From smoky clubs to symphony halls, jazz pushed boundaries and redefined what music could be. It doesn’t just follow the rules—it rewrites them in real time. </p>

  <!-- === Country === -->
  <section class="genre-section">
    <h2 class="genre-heading">Country</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">Country music is all about stories—tales of love, heartbreak, hometowns, and highways. Born in the American South in the 1920s, it mixes folk roots, bluesy twang, and a whole lot of heart. With acoustic guitars, fiddles, and that signature Southern drawl, country music turns everyday moments into sing-along anthems. Whether you're two-stepping in a honky-tonk or crying in your truck, country keeps it real, raw, and relatable. Boots optional, feelings guaranteed.</p>

  <!-- === Swing === -->
  <section class="genre-section">
    <h2 class="genre-heading">Swing</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">Swing is jazz’s lively, dance-obsessed cousin. Bursting onto the scene in the 1930s and ‘40s, swing brought big bands, bold brass sections, and infectious rhythms that got everyone on their feet. With its bouncy beat and smooth style, swing music ruled dance halls and airwaves, setting the stage for everything from bebop to early rock ‘n’ roll. It’s music made to move to—slick, stylish, and impossible to sit still through.</p>

  <!-- === R&B === -->
  <section class="genre-section">
    <h2 class="genre-heading">R&B</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">R&B is the sound of groove and emotion coming together. Emerging in the 1940s, it fused jazz, gospel, and blues into something silky, heartfelt, and full of rhythm. Over the decades, R&B has evolved from doo-wop and soul to contemporary hits that blend seamlessly with pop, hip-hop, and electronic beats. With smooth vocals, steady beats, and lyrics that speak to love, heartbreak, and everything in between</p>

  <!-- === Pop === -->
  <section class="genre-section">
    <h2 class="genre-heading">Pop</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">Pop is music’s ultimate crowd-pleaser—catchy, colorful, and constantly evolving. Short for “popular,” pop pulls bits and pieces from every genre (think rock, R&B, hip-hop, even country!) to create songs that get stuck in your head—in the best way. With sing-along hooks, polished production, and a flair for reinvention, pop has dominated charts and dance floors for decades. It’s the sound of the moment—and sometimes, the whole generation.</p>

  <!-- === Rock ’n Roll === -->
  <section class="genre-section">
    <h2 class="genre-heading">Rock ’n Roll</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">Rebellion in rhythm. Rock ’n roll fused blues, country, and swagger into a cultural force that redefined youth, fashion, and volume itself. With electric guitars, pounding drums, and unforgettable hooks, it gave us anthems for generations. Born in the 1950s, it inspired social change, soundtracked revolutions, and carved out legends—from Elvis to punk and grunge. Rock isn’t just a sound—it’s a spirit that shouts back at the world.</p>
