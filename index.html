  <h1>Music isn’t just a subject to study; it’s a journey through history itself.</h1>
  <p>Music is constantly evolving—but like any good remix, it never forgets its roots. From jazz riffs showing up in hip-hop beats to classical drama woven into cinematic pop, every genre borrows, blends, and builds off the ones before it. In this project, I’m exploring the DNA of music: how genres have shifted over time, gained popularity, and cross-pollinated with one another—yet still carry traces of their original essence. Because in the world of music, everything changes, but the rhythm of inspiration stays the same.</p>

    <h2 class="genre-heading">Classical</h2>
    <h3>Emerged in 1820</h3>
    <p class="genre-description">Classical music is the OG of organized sound—think sweeping symphonies, dramatic crescendos, and intricate harmonies. Born in 18th-century Europe, it set the foundation for Western music with legendary composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach leading the charge. While it may not dominate Spotify charts today, its influence echoes through movie scores, pop ballads, and even video game soundtracks. Timeless, technical, and totally dramatic—classical music is proof that good composition never goes out of style.</p>

    <h2 class="genre-heading">Blues</h2>
    <h3>Emerged in 1860</h3>
    <p class="genre-description">Blues is raw emotion turned into rhythm—born from the deep South in the late 1800s, it gave a voice to struggle, soul, and storytelling. With its signature 12-bar structure, moody guitar riffs, and heartfelt lyrics, blues laid the groundwork for genres like rock, jazz, and hip-hop. It's the kind of music that says a lot with just a few notes—and somehow, it always hits you right in the feels. Simple, soulful, and seriously influential, blues is the heartache that built a music empire.</p>

    <h2 class="genre-heading">Jazz</h2>
    <h3>Emerged in 1910</h3>
    <p class="genre-description">Jazz is music with a mind of its own—improvised, unpredictable, and always cool. Born in the 1920s in New Orleans, jazz blended blues, ragtime, and classical flair into something bold and brand new. It’s known for swing rhythms, soulful solos, and that “you had to be there” kind of energy. From smoky clubs to symphony halls, jazz pushed boundaries and redefined what music could be. It doesn’t just follow the rules—it rewrites them in real time. </p>

    <h3>Emerged in 1920</h3>
    <p class="genre-description">Country music is all about stories—tales of love, heartbreak, hometowns, and highways. Born in the American South in the 1920s, it mixes folk roots, bluesy twang, and a whole lot of heart. With acoustic guitars, fiddles, and that signature Southern drawl, country music turns everyday moments into sing-along anthems. Whether you're two-stepping in a honky-tonk or crying in your truck, country keeps it real, raw, and relatable. Boots optional, feelings guaranteed.</p>
